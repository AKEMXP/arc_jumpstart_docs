## Enhance operational insights at the edge using Azure IoT Operations (AIO)

Contoso Bakeries, a fictional company, requires dashboards and analytics on the edge (in its plant) and in Azure to provide real-time operational data to plant operators such as Operational Technology (OT) Managers, Operators, and Maintenance personnel. This includes insights into production line operations and key performance indicators (KPIs) like overall equipment effectiveness (OEE), downtime, and waste. A prime focus is on data from critical equipment like fryers. Additionally, regional executives and directors are interested in supervising main KPIs across multiple plants remotely.

## Architecture

The solution for Contoso will involve deploying the following:

- A Kubernetes cluster on the edge using [AKS Edge Essentials](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/hybrid/aks-edge-overview), managed by Azure Arc, which hosts various [Azure IoT Operations](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/iot-operations/get-started/overview-iot-operations) services.
- A custom-developed MQTT-Simulator that mimics plant and fryer data, transmitting it to Azure IoT MQ via MQTT.
- An MQTT-listener service that captures this production line data, sending it to an open source [InfluxDb](https://www.influxdata.com/) on the edge, generating near real-time dashboards and analytics and visualizes it using [Grafana](https://Grafana.com/).
- An Azure IoT MQ connection with [Azure Event Grid namespace](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/event-grid/create-view-manage-namespaces), an MQTT broker integrated into Azure, pushing data to Azure Event Grid and subsequently to [Azure Data Explorer](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/data-explorer/).
- Azure Data Explorer dashboards and analytics for supervisory and executive roles monitoring multiple plants' operations.

> **Note:** Currently, Azure IoT Operations is in preview.

![Screenshot showing an architecture diagram](./01.png)

The following Jumpstart scenario will show how to create an AKS Edge Essentials cluster in Azure Windows Server VM and connect the Azure VM and AKS Edge Essentials cluster to Azure Arc using [Azure Bicep](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/overview). The provided Bicep template is responsible for creating the Azure resources as well as executing the LogonScript including AKS Edge Essentials cluster creation, AIO deployment, Azure resource deployment, and Azure Arc onboarding (Azure VM and AKS Edge Essentials cluster) on the Azure VM.

> **Note:** It is not expected to use a nested virtualization in a production environment, let alone using an Azure VM to do so. The below scenario is unsupported and should ONLY be used for demo and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites

- [Install or update Azure CLI to version 2.65.0.0 or above](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest). Use the following command to check your current installed version.

    ```shell
    az --version
    ```

- Login to Azure CLI using the *`az login`* command.

- Ensure that you have selected the correct subscription you want to deploy AIO to by using the *`az account list --query "[?isDefault]"`* command. If you need to adjust the active subscription used by Az CLI, follow [this guidance](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/manage-azure-subscriptions-azure-cli#change-the-active-subscription).

- AIO must be deployed to one of the following regions. **Deploying AIO outside of these regions may result in unexpected results or deployment errors.**

  - East US 2
  - West US 2
  - North Europe
  - West Europe

- **AIO requires 8 Ds-series vCPUs**. Ensure you have sufficient vCPU quota available in your Azure subscription and the region where you plan to deploy AIO. You can use the below Az CLI command to check your vCPU utilization.

  ```shell
  az vm list-usage --location <your location> --output table
  ```

  ![Screenshot showing az vm list-usage](./02.png)

- **AIO requires 1 Public IP address**. Ensure you have sufficient public IP addresses available in your Azure subscription and the region where you plan to deploy AIO.

- Register necessary Azure resource providers by running the following commands.

  ```shell
  az provider register --namespace Microsoft.Kusto --wait
  az provider register --namespace Microsoft.EventGrid --wait
  az provider register --namespace Microsoft.EventHub --wait
  az provider register --namespace Microsoft.KeyVault --wait
  az provider register --namespace Microsoft.Storage --wait
  ```

- Create Azure service principal (SP). An Azure service principal assigned with the *Owner* Role-based access control (RBAC) role is required. You can use Azure Cloud Shell (or other Bash shell), or PowerShell to create the service principal.

  - (Option 1) Create service principal using [Azure Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com/) or Bash shell with Azure CLI:

    ```shell
    az login
    subscriptionId=$(az account show --query id --output tsv)
    az ad sp create-for-rbac -n "<Unique SP Name>" --role "Owner" --scopes /subscriptions/$subscriptionId
    ```

    For example:

    ```shell
    az login
    subscriptionId=$(az account show --query id --output tsv)
    az ad sp create-for-rbac -n "JumpstartAIOSP" --role "Owner" --scopes /subscriptions/$subscriptionId
    ```

    Output should look similar to this:

    ```json
    {
    "appId": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
    "displayName": "JumpstartAIOSP",
    "password": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
    "tenant": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
    }
    ```

    To get the service principal object id, you can run the following command

    ```shell
    az ad sp list --display-name "<Unique SP Name>" --query "[].{Name:displayName, ObjectId:id}"
    ```

  - (Option 2) Create service principal using PowerShell. If necessary, follow [this documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/azure/install-az-ps?view=azps-8.3.0) to install or update Azure PowerShell to version 10.4.0 or above.

    ```powershell
    $account = Connect-AzAccount
    $spn = New-AzADServicePrincipal -DisplayName "<Unique SPN name>" -Role "Owner" -Scope "/subscriptions/$($account.Context.Subscription.Id)"
    echo "SPN App id: $($spn.AppId)"
    echo "SPN secret: $($spn.PasswordCredentials.SecretText)"
    echo "SPN tenant: $($account.Context.Tenant.Id)"
    echo "SPN object id: $($spn.Id)"
    ```

    For example:

    ```powershell
    $account = Connect-AzAccount
    $spn = New-AzADServicePrincipal -DisplayName "JumpstartAIOSP" -Role "Owner" -Scope "/subscriptions/$($account.Context.Subscription.Id)"
    echo "SPN App id: $($spn.AppId)"
    echo "SPN secret: $($spn.PasswordCredentials.SecretText)"
    echo "SPN object id: $($spn.Id)"
    ```

    Output should look similar to this:

    ![Screenshot showing creating an SPN with PowerShell](./13.png)

    > **Note:** If you create multiple subsequent role assignments on the same service principal, your client secret (password) will be destroyed and recreated each time. Therefore, make sure you grab the correct secret

    > **Note:** The Jumpstart scenarios are designed with as much ease of use in mind and adhering to security-related best practices whenever possible. It is optional but highly recommended to scope the service principal to a specific [Azure subscription and resource group](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/ad/sp?view=azure-cli-latest) as well as considering using a [less privileged service principal account](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/best-practices).

- AIO requires creating a "user_impersonation" delegated permission on Azure Key Vault for this service principal.

  - Navigate to *Microsoft Entra Id* (previously known as Azure Active Directory) in the Azure portal.

    ![Screenshot showing searching for Microsoft Entra ID in the Azure portal](./03.png)

  - Click on "App registrations" and search for the name of the service principal you created.

    ![Screenshot showing searching for the service principal in the Entra Id portal](./04.png)

  - Click on "API permissions" and add a new permission.

    ![Screenshot showing adding a new API permission](./05.png)

  - Select "Azure Key Vault".

    ![Screenshot showing adding a new API permission](./06.png)

  - Click on "Delegated permissions" and select the "user_impersonation" permission.

    ![Screenshot showing adding a new API permission](./07.png)

    ![Screenshot showing added API permission](./08.png)

## Deployment via Azure Developer CLI

- Follow the install guide for the [Azure Developer CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd?tabs=winget-windows%2Cbrew-mac%2Cscript-linux&pivots=os-linux) for your environment.

  > **Note:** PowerShell is required for using azd with Jumpstart AIO. If you are running in a Linux environment be sure that you have [PowerShell for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-linux?view=powershell-7.3) installed.

- Run *`Connect-AzAccount`* which will open a prompt for interactive login for Azure PowerShell.

  ![Screenshot showing azure powershell login](./09.png)

- Login with azd using *`azd auth login`* which will open a browser for a similar interactive login for Azure Developer CLI.

- Run the *`azd init`* command from your cloned repo *azure_arc_jumpstart/azure_edge_iot_ops_jumpstart/aio_manufacturing* folder.

  ![Screenshot showing azd init](./10.png)

- Run the *`azd up`* command to deploy the environment. Azd will prompt you to enter the target subscription, region and all required parameters.

  ![Screenshot showing azd up](./11.png)

## Deployment: Bicep deployment via Azure CLI

- Upgrade to latest Bicep version

  ```shell
  az bicep upgrade
  ```

- Edit the [main.parameters.json](https://github.com/microsoft/azure_arc/blob/main/azure_edge_iot_ops_jumpstart/aio_manufacturing/bicep/main.parameters.json) template parameters file and supply some values for your environment.
  - *`spnClientId`* - Your Azure service principal application id
  - *`spnObjectId`* Your Azure service principal object id
  - *`spnClientSecret`* - Your Azure service principal secret
  - *`spnTenantId`* - Your Azure tenant id
  - *`windowsAdminUsername`* - Client Windows VM Administrator username
  - *`windowsAdminPassword`* - Client Windows VM Password. Password must have 3 of the following: 1 lower case character, 1 upper case character, 1 number, and 1 special character. The value must be between 12 and 123 characters long.
  - *`deployBastion`* - Option to deploy using Azure Bastion instead of traditional RDP. Set to true or false.

  ![Screenshot showing example parameters](./12.png)

- You will need to get the Azure Custom Location Resource Provider (RP) Object ID (OID) and export it as an environment variable. This is required to enable [Custom Location](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-arc/platform/conceptual-custom-locations) on your cluster.

> **Note:** You need permissions to list all the service principals.

### Option 1: Bash

  ```shell
  customLocationRPOID=$(az ad sp list --filter "displayname eq 'Custom Locations RP'" --query "[?appDisplayName=='Custom Locations RP'].id" -o tsv)
  ```

### Option 2: PowerShell

  ```powershell
  $customLocationRPOID=(az ad sp list --filter "displayname eq 'Custom Locations RP'" --query "[?appDisplayName=='Custom Locations RP'].id" -o tsv)
  ```

- Now you will deploy the Bicep file. Navigate to the local cloned [deployment folder](https://github.com/microsoft/azure_arc/tree/main/azure_edge_iot_ops_jumpstart/aio_manufacturing/bicep) and run the below command:

  ```shell
  az login
  az group create --name "<resource-group-name>"  --location "<preferred-location>"
  az deployment group create -g "<resource-group-name>" -f "main.bicep" -p "main.parameters.json" -p customLocationRPOID="$customLocationRPOID"
  ```

## Start post-deployment automation

Once your deployment is complete, you can open the Azure portal and see the AIO scenario resources inside your resource group. You will be using the *AIO-Client-VM* Azure virtual machine to explore various capabilities of AIO. You will need to remotely access *AIO-Client-VM*.

  ![Screenshot showing all deployed resources in the resource group](./14.png)

   > **Note:** For enhanced security posture, RDP (3389) and SSH (22) ports are not open by default in AIO deployments. You will need to create a network security group (NSG) rule to allow network access to port 3389, or use [Azure Bastion](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/bastion/bastion-overview) or [Just-in-Time (JIT)](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/defender-for-cloud/just-in-time-access-usage?tabs=jit-config-asc%2Cjit-request-asc) access to connect to the VM

## Connecting to the AIO Client virtual machine

Various options are available to connect to *AIO-Client-VM*, depending on the parameters you supplied during deployment.

- [RDP](#connecting-directly-with-rdp) - available after configuring access to port 3389 on the *AIO-NSG-Prod*, or by enabling [Just-in-Time access (JIT)](#connect-using-just-in-time-access-jit).
- [Azure Bastion](#connect-using-azure-bastion) - available if *`true`* was the value of your *`deployBastion`* parameter during deployment.

### Connecting directly with RDP

By design, port 3389 isn't opened by default on the network security group. Therefore, you must create an NSG rule to allow inbound 3389.

- Open the *AIO-NSG-Prod* resource in Azure portal and click "Add" to add a new rule.

  ![Screenshot showing adding a new inbound security rule](./15.png)

  ![Screenshot showing adding a new allow RDP inbound security rule](./16.png)

- Select My IP address from the dropdown.

  ![Screenshot showing adding a new allow RDP inbound security rule](./17.png)

  ![Screenshot showing all inbound security rule](./18.png)

  ![Screenshot showing connecting to the VM using RDP](./19.png)

### Connect using Azure Bastion

- If you have chosen to deploy Azure Bastion in your deployment, use it to connect to the VM.

  ![Screenshot showing connecting to the VM using Bastion](./20.png)

  > **Note:** When using Azure Bastion, the desktop background image is not visible. Therefore some screenshots in this guide may not exactly match your experience if you are connecting to *AIO-Client-VM* with Azure Bastion

### Connect using just-in-time access (JIT)

If you already have [Microsoft Defender for Cloud](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/defender-for-cloud/just-in-time-access-usage?tabs=jit-config-asc%2Cjit-request-asc) enabled on your subscription and would like to use JIT to access the Client VM, use the following steps:

- In the Client VM configuration pane, enable just-in-time. This will enable the default settings.

  ![Screenshot showing how to enable JIT](./21.png)

  ![Screenshot showing how to enable JIT](./22.png)

  ![Screenshot showing connecting to the VM using RDP](./23.png)

## Post deployment

- Once you log into the *AIO-Client-VM*, multiple automated scripts will open and start running. These scripts usually take around thirty minutes to finish, and once completed, the script windows will close automatically. At this point, the deployment is complete.

  ![Screenshot showing AIO resources in Azure portal](./49.png)

- Deployment is complete! Let's begin exploring how Contoso staff can start using the deployed solution.

## Industrial telemetry at the edge

The automation deploys and configures a simulator that simulates data from various bakery equipment, such as ovens, dividers, and mixers, including a dedicated simulation for a fryer unit - a critical asset in the bakery's production line. The MQTT listener captures this data and funnels it to InfluxDB which is optimized for time-series data. 

Grafana, a leading open-source platform for monitoring and observability, taps into InfluxDB to render comprehensive dashboards and analytics, enabling the plant staff at Contoso to monitor and enhance the performance of the strawberry donut production line effectively. Those dashboards provide near real-time information and insights, often projected directly within the production line area, to enable immediate response and decision-making where it matters most.

- Open the MQTT explorer desktop shortcut, it is already configured to connect to the MQTT listener on the cluster.

  ![Screenshot showing opening MQTT explorer on the desktop](./50.png)

- Once connected, you will start seeing simulated data being transmitted with various metrics from the plant assets.

  ![Screenshot showing the simulated data](./51.png)

  ![Screenshot showing the simulated data](./52.png)

  ![Screenshot showing the simulated data](./53.png)

- To enable the plant staff to monitor and visualize this data in real-time, open the Edge browser, expand InfluxDB in the Favorites Bar, and select *AIO - InfluxDB*.

  ![Screenshot showing opening influx bookmark](./54.png)

- Login with the Administrator username and password provided when you created the deployment.

  ![Screenshot showing logging into InfluxDB](./55.png)

- Click on dashboards and select the "Contoso Bakery Strawberry Donut production line" dashboard.

  ![Screenshot showing the Grafana dashboard](./56.png)

- Contoso staff can start monitoring the strawberry donut production line. The most critical KPI featured is the Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE). The OEE indicator is color-coded for at-a-glance status updates:

  | Color   | Indication                                                        |
  | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
  | Green   | 🟩 OEE above the target range of 90% (optimal performance)        |
  | Yellow  | 🟨 OEE between 80% to 90% (acceptable but suboptimal performance) |
  | Red     | 🟥 OEE below 80% (immediate attention needed)                     |


  ![Screenshot showing the Grafana dashboard](./57.png)

- Additionally, the dashboard breaks down the components of OEE; *Availability*, *Product Quality*, and *Performance*, to provide a detailed analysis. A key focus is on *Availability*, with constant monitoring of downtime to identify and classify lost time reasons, such as equipment malfunctions or ingredient shortages.

  ![Screenshot showing the Grafana dashboard](./58.png)

- Users can also view real-time data on the current product being produced, strawberry donuts, as well as the active shift, which in this case is the morning shift.

  ![Screenshot showing the Grafana dashboard](./59.png)

- Critical equipment, such as the fryer, is under special surveillance. The dashboard displays the current oil temperature against the target temperature, along with the oil level in the fryer, ensuring that any deviations from the norm can be quickly addressed.

## Advanced executive dashboards using Azure Data Explorer (ADX)

The automation deploys an ADX cluster and provides a dashboard for Contoso's regional executives and directors who require a broader view across multiple plants. The Azure IoT MQ in the local cluster transmits data to Azure Event Grid, which acts as a cloud-based MQTT broker. It receives operational data and routes it to Azure Event Grid topics, and from there to the Event Hub. Event Hub streamlines the data inflow, allowing ADX to ingest it. Using Kusto Query Language (KQL), Azure Data Explorer provides advanced analytics and custom dashboards that give executives insights into the performance of multiple plants which is crucial for strategic decision-making and long-term planning.

> **Note:** See the diagram in the [Architecture section](#architecture) for more context**

### Manually import dashboards

> **Note:** If you used the [Azure Developer CLI (azd) method](#deployment-via-azure-developer-cli) to deploy the scenario, you may skip this section as these reports are automatically imported for you during the automated deployment

Follow the below steps in order to view the dashboard reports, you will need to import them into ADX.

- On the Client VM, open Windows Explorer and navigate to folder *C:\AIO\adx_dashboard* folder. This folder contains an ADX dashboard report JSON file (*dashboard.json*) with the ADX URI updated when the deployment PowerShell logon script is completed.

  ![Screenshot showing the dashboard report template files location](./60.png)

- Copy this ADX dashboard report JSON file on your local machine in a temporary folder to import into ADX dashboards. Alternatively, you can log in to ADX Dashboards directly on the Client VM.

  > **Note:** Depending on the account being used to log in to the ADX portal, the Azure AD tenant of that account may have conditional access policies enabled to allow access only from corporate-managed devices (for example managed by Microsoft Intune) and might prevent login to ADX Dashboards from the Client VM as this VM is not managed by your organization

- On your local machine open the browser of your choice OR on the Client VM open the Edge browser and log in to [ADX Dashboards](https://dataexplorer.azure.com/). Use the same user account that you deployed the scenario in your subscription. Failure to use the same account will prevent access to the ADX Orders database to generate reports.

- Once you are logged in to ADX dashboards, click on Dashboards in the left navigation to import the dashboard report.

  ![Screenshot showing how to navigate to ADX dashboard reports](./61.png)

- Select "Import dashboard from file" to select previously copied file from the Client VM to your local machine or the *C:\AIO\adx_dashboard* folder on the Client VM.

  ![Screenshot showing the import dashboard file](./62.png)

- Choose to import the *dashboard.json* file.

  ![Screenshot showing the dashboard report JSON file to import](./63.png)

- Confirm the dashboard report name, accept the suggested name (or choose your own), and click Create.

  ![Screenshot showing the dashboard report name confirmation](./64.png)

- It might take a couple of minutes for the dashboard to display some data in the report after deployment. Click Save to save the dashboard report in ADX.

  ![Screenshot showing the empty data in orders dashboard report](./65.png)

- Contoso staff can start leveraging the dashboards, for instance, a regional manager overseeing three plants might use the ADX dashboard to assess the collective OEE of these facilities. The dashboard aggregates essential metrics such as Overall OEE, Performance, and Availability, offering a consolidated view of productivity and efficiency. It highlights the most prevalent current shift's waste reason - in this case, 'Overcooked' and quantifies waste volumes alongside unplanned downtimes and their duration in minutes.

- Furthermore, these stakeholders often engage in comparative analysis. The ADX dashboard enables them to compare the performance across the different shifts operating within a single plant, discerning the OEE for primary products like donuts, bread, and pastries. It also facilitates a comparative review of the OEE across the three plants located in Seattle, Mexico City, and Miami. Quality indicators are also on display, ensuring products meet the required specifications in size and weight.

  ![Screenshot showing the OEE ADX dashboard](./66.png)

- Critical quality-affecting factors, such as the oil temperature in fryers which can influence the color, size, or doneness of donuts, are also monitored. This level of detail provides executives with the data needed to make informed decisions, ensuring product consistency and operational excellence across the board.

## Cleanup deployment

- To clean up your deployment, simply delete the resource group using Azure CLI or Azure portal.

  ```shell
  az group delete -n <name of your resource group>
  ```

  ![Screenshot showing az group delete](./67.png)

  ![Screenshot showing group delete from Azure portal](./68.png)

- If you used Azure Developer CLI to deploy then *`azd down`* can be used instead.

  ![Screenshot showing azd down](./69.png)
