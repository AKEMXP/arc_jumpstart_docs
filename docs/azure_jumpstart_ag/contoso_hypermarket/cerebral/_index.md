# Cerebral: AI-Powered Retail Assistant

## Executive Summary

Cerebral is an advanced AI assistant designed for Contoso HyperMarket that leverages both edge computing and cloud capabilities to provide intelligent decision support across various retail operations. By combining local language models with cloud AI services, Cerebral creates a robust system that helps staff access information efficiently, automates routine tasks, and provides proactive insights for better decision-making.

## Business Challenge

Retail operations face several critical challenges:
- Information siloing across multiple systems
- Long learning curves for new employees
- Time-consuming manual lookups of technical documentation
- Delayed response to inventory issues
- Complex decision-making requiring data from multiple sources
- Inefficient maintenance operations due to scattered technical documentation

## Solution Overview

Cerebral addresses these challenges through a hybrid architecture that combines edge computing with cloud services, providing intelligent assistance across all retail operations.

### Key Features
- Natural language querying of business data
- Proactive inventory alerts
- Maintenance documentation assistance
- Sales and inventory trend analysis
- Real-time operational insights
- Multi-source data integration

### Architecture Components

#### Frontend Layer
- **React JS Web Application**: Provides the user interface for store managers, logistics managers, and operations managers
- **Chatbot Interface**: Enables natural language interactions and notifications

#### Processing Layer
- **Decision Tree Classification**: Routes queries to appropriate data sources based on query type
- **RAG-based Query Processing**: Implements Retrieval Augmented Generation for contextualized responses
- **Edge Processing**: Uses Microsoft Phi-3 Mini-4k model for local processing
- **Azure OpenAI Integration**: Handles complex queries requiring cloud computing power

#### Data Layer
- **Chroma Vector Database**: Stores and indexes operational manuals and documentation
- **SQL Server**: Manages commercial data (sales, inventory)
- **InfluxDB**: Handles time-series data for operational metrics
- **Azure IoT Operations**: Manages device telemetry and operational data

#### Infrastructure
- **Edge-located Arc-enabled Kubernetes cluster**: Hosts the local processing components
- **Microsoft Fabric**: Provides data integration and analytics capabilities
- **Power BI Dashboards**: Delivers real-time visualization of metrics

## Use Cases

### Store Management
- Proactive inventory alerts
- Sales trend analysis
- Automated stock level monitoring
- Performance metrics visualization

### Maintenance Operations
- Quick access to technical documentation
- Troubleshooting assistance
- Equipment status monitoring
- Preventive maintenance scheduling

### Employee Support
- Reduced training time
- Instant access to operational procedures

## Technical Implementation

### Query Processing Flow
1. User submits natural language query
2. Query classification determines data source:
   - Document queries → Chroma vector database
   - Real-time operational data → InfluxDB
   - Business data → SQL Server
3. Query translation to appropriate format (SQL, InfluxQL, or vector search)
4. Data retrieval and contextualization
5. Response generation using local or cloud AI models

### Edge Computing
