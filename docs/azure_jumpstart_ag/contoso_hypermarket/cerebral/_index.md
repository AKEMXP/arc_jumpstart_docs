## Architecture

The power of Cerebral lies in its sophisticated hybrid architecture that balances local processing with cloud capabilities. At its core, Cerebral operates on an edge-located Arc-enabled Kubernetes cluster, which hosts the local language model (Microsoft Phi-3 Mini-4k) for rapid response to common queries. This edge infrastructure connects seamlessly with cloud services through Azure IoT Operations, enabling a robust and scalable system that can handle everything from simple information requests to complex analytical queries.

Cerebral exposes its functionality through a comprehensive API layer that supports both REST and WebSocket connections, enabling real-time interactions and seamless integration with applications like the Contoso Hypermarket web interface.

At its core, Cerebral employs a sophisticated query processing orchestrator that intelligently routes requests to appropriate data sources based on the nature of the query. For commercial data such as sales, inventory, and customer information, the system interfaces with SQL Server. Real-time device metrics and operational data are managed through InfluxDB, a specialized time-series database that captures everything from equipment performance to environmental readings. Technical documentation and operational procedures are accessed through a Chroma vector database, enabling powerful RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) capabilities.

The system's AI processing capabilities are designed for flexibility, with the ability to leverage either Azure OpenAI for complex cloud-based processing or Small Language Models (SLM) for edge processing. This hybrid approach ensures optimal performance while maintaining data privacy and enabling offline operations when needed.

To support development, testing, and demonstrations, Cerebral includes a sophisticated data simulator that generates realistic streams of commercial transactions, device telemetry, and equipment status updates. This simulation capability is crucial for system validation and training scenarios.

While currently demonstrated within Contoso Hypermarket's retail environment, the architecture is inherently designed for multi-industry adaptation. New data sources, industry verticals, and processing pipelines can be seamlessly integrated, ensuring that Cerebral can evolve to meet the needs of diverse operational contexts while maintaining consistent performance and reliability.


### Data Integration and Query Processing

At the heart of Cerebral's architecture lies a sophisticated data integration system that seamlessly connects diverse information sources through an intelligent query processing pipeline. This unified approach transforms how organizations access and utilize their operational data.

#### Unified Data Sources

The system orchestrates three specialized databases, each optimized for specific types of information and query patterns:

**Chroma Vector Database** serves as the foundation for Cerebral's documentation intelligence. By indexing technical manuals, maintenance procedures, and operational guides, it enables sophisticated semantic search capabilities through Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). This allows Cerebral to understand the context and intent behind documentation queries, delivering precise and relevant information to users.
  
* Stores and indexes technical documentation
* Enables semantic search capabilities
* Manages operational procedures and maintenance guides
* Facilitates contextual information retrieval

**InfluxDB** powers Cerebral's real-time operational insights by managing time-series data from store equipment and systems. This specialized database captures everything from refrigeration temperatures to checkout queue lengths, enabling rapid analysis of current conditions and historical trends. Its optimized time-series capabilities ensure swift access to performance metrics and environmental data when seconds matter.

* Captures real-time metrics from store equipment
* Monitors system performance data
* Tracks operational status
* Stores historical trending data

**SQL Server** handles all commercial operations data, providing a robust foundation for business intelligence. From transaction processing to inventory management, this relational database ensures accurate tracking of sales patterns, stock levels, and customer interactions, enabling data-driven decision making across the organization.

* Manages transaction records
* Tracks inventory levels
* Stores customer data
* Handles business intelligence queries

#### Intelligent Query Routing

![Decision Tree Architecture](./img/decision-tree.png)

When a user interacts with Cerebral, their natural language query flows through a sophisticated decision tree that determines the optimal processing path. Questions about maintenance procedures are seamlessly routed to the vector database, equipment status checks are directed to the time-series database, and sales inquiries are processed through the relational database. This intelligent routing ensures that each query is handled by the most appropriate system, delivering fast, accurate responses while maintaining system efficiency.

For example, when a maintenance technician asks "How do I calibrate Scale-02?", Cerebral recognizes this as a documentation query and leverages RAG to search the vector database for relevant procedures. Conversely, a store manager asking "What were our top-selling products today?" triggers a SQL query to analyze recent transaction data.



## Interacting with Cerebral

Throughout the Contoso Hypermarket interface, whether you're a store manager reviewing sales data, a maintenance technician checking equipment status, or a shopper seeking assistance, you'll find the Cerebral AI assistant readily available through its distinctive icon ![Ceerebral icon](./img/cerebral-icon.png) located in the top navigation bar. Clicking this icon opens a sliding panel interface where you can seamlessly interact with Cerebral using either text or voice input.

The interaction is straightforward and natural - simply type your question or click the microphone icon to speak. Cerebral understands natural language queries across a wide range of topics, for example:
