## Real-time footfall inferencing and shopper insights

Contoso Hypermarket uses computer vision to enhance the customer in-store experience and to provide employees with advanced tools for improving store operations. In-store cameras detect shopper behavior such as foot traffic, time spent in certain zones of the store, and shopper-specific identifiers that personalize the shopping experience.

## Enhancing store operations with footfall detection

The store manager uses the UI to monitor shopper behaviors and patterns. This includes identifying high traffic areas within the store, which helps in optimizing store layout and product placement. The manager can also configure cameras and zones for computer vision, ensuring that the system accurately captures and analyzes shopper movements. This setup allows the store manager to make data-driven decisions to enhance the shopping experience and improve store operations.

#### Regional manager / data analyst

The regional manager will leverage the footfall and shopper insights data from various stores through aggregated dashboards in Fabric. These dashboards provide a comprehensive view of shopper behaviors and patterns across multiple locations, enabling the regional manager to identify trends and make informed decisions. By analyzing high traffic areas, peak shopping times, and customer preferences, the regional manager can optimize store layouts, improve product placement, and tailor marketing strategies to enhance the overall shopping experience. Additionally, the insights gathered from the dashboards help in identifying operational inefficiencies and areas for improvement, ensuring that each store operates at its best.
