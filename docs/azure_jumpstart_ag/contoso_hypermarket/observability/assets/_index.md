This holistic approach to asset management ensures that all industrial assets are functioning optimally, contributing to the smooth operation of the hypermarket.

## Observability architecture components

Contoso Hypermarket uses several observability components to monitor and manage industrial assets such as refrigerators, ovens, HVACs, and retail smart shelves. The key components used are:

- **Azure IoT Operations**: Facilitates the connection and management of IoT devices, enabling real-time monitoring and control of industrial assets.
- **MQTT**: A lightweight messaging protocol used for efficient communication between IoT devices and the cloud.
- **Prometheus**: An open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit used to collect and store metrics from industrial assets.
- **Grafana**: A multi-platform open-source analytics and interactive visualization web application used to create dashboards and graphs from the metrics collected by Prometheus.
- **Microsoft PowerBI**: A business analytics service that provides interactive visualizations and business intelligence capabilities with an interface simple enough for end users to create their own reports and dashboards.

These components work together to provide a comprehensive view of the status and health of industrial assets, ensuring optimal performance and quick identification of any issues.
